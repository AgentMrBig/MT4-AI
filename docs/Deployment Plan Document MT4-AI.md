# Deployment Plan Document for MT4-AI Trading System

---

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose
The purpose of this Deployment Plan Document is to outline the steps, procedures, and resources required to deploy the MT4-AI Trading System. This document will ensure that the system is deployed efficiently, securely, and with minimal disruption to operations.

### 1.2 Scope
This document covers the deployment of all components of the MT4-AI Trading System, including the MT4 Expert Advisor (EA), the Machine Learning "Brain," and the Web Application. It includes deployment preparation, installation, configuration, validation, and post-deployment steps.

## 2. Deployment Overview

### 2.1 Deployment Strategy
The MT4-AI Trading System will be deployed in phases to minimize risk and ensure that each component is functioning correctly before moving on to the next phase. The deployment will follow a **staging-to-production** approach, where the system is first deployed in a staging environment for testing and validation before being deployed in the production environment.

### 2.2 Deployment Phases
- **Phase 1: Preparation**
  - Ensure all hardware and software prerequisites are met.
  - Set up the staging environment on AWS.
  - Prepare deployment scripts and configuration files.
  
- **Phase 2: Deployment to Staging**
  - Deploy the MT4 EA, "Brain," and Web App in the staging environment.
  - Perform initial configuration and integration testing.
  - Validate the systemâ€™s functionality in staging.

- **Phase 3: Validation**
  - Conduct User Acceptance Testing (UAT) in the staging environment.
  - Gather feedback and make necessary adjustments.
  - Perform final performance and security testing.

- **Phase 4: Deployment to Production**
  - Deploy the system to the production environment.
  - Perform final configuration and verification.
  - Monitor the system closely during the initial operation.

- **Phase 5: Post-Deployment**
  - Conduct post-deployment monitoring and support.
  - Document any issues and solutions encountered during deployment.
  - Finalize deployment documentation and close the project.

## 3. Prerequisites

### 3.1 Hardware Requirements
- **Servers:** AWS EC2 instances configured with appropriate CPU, memory, and storage for the "Brain" and Web App.
- **Local Machines:** Windows-based machines with MetaTrader 4 installed for deploying the MT4 EA.

### 3.2 Software Requirements
- **Operating System:** 
  - MT4 EA: Windows 10 or higher.
  - "Brain" and Web App: Linux (Ubuntu 20.04) or Windows Server 2019.
- **Database:** AWS RDS for relational database services, if needed.
- **Application Frameworks:** Python 3.x for the "Brain," Flask/Django for the Web App.
- **Dependencies:** All Python and application dependencies should be listed in a `requirements.txt` file or equivalent.

### 3.3 Network Requirements
- **Network Security:** Ensure that security groups and firewalls allow necessary traffic between MT4 EA, "Brain," and Web App.
- **DNS Configuration:** Set up DNS entries for the Web App to be accessible from the public internet.

## 4. Deployment Process

### 4.1 Preparation
- **Review Deployment Checklist:** Verify that all prerequisites are met.
- **Backup Existing Systems:** Ensure that any existing systems that will be replaced or affected by this deployment are fully backed up.
- **Prepare Deployment Scripts:** Create and test deployment scripts for automating the deployment process (e.g., Ansible, Terraform).

### 4.2 Deployment to Staging
- **Provision AWS Resources:** Use Terraform or AWS Console to provision EC2 instances, RDS, and other necessary resources in the staging environment.
- **Deploy "Brain":** Deploy the Machine Learning "Brain" on the staging server using deployment scripts.
- **Deploy Web App:** Deploy the Web App on the staging server, ensuring it can communicate with the "Brain."
- **Deploy MT4 EA:** Deploy the MT4 EA on a test MT4 instance and configure it to communicate with the "Brain."

### 4.3 Validation in Staging
- **Integration Testing:** Perform integration testing between MT4 EA, "Brain," and Web App to ensure all components are working together.
- **User Acceptance Testing (UAT):** Engage with users to test the system in the staging environment.
- **Performance Testing:** Run performance tests to ensure the system can handle expected loads.

### 4.4 Deployment to Production
- **Provision Production Environment:** Set up the production environment on AWS, similar to the staging environment.
- **Migrate Data:** If applicable, migrate necessary data from staging to production.
- **Deploy Components:** Deploy the MT4 EA, "Brain," and Web App to the production environment using tested deployment scripts.
- **Final Configuration:** Configure the system in production and ensure all settings match the required production configurations.

### 4.5 Post-Deployment
- **Monitor System:** Use monitoring tools (e.g., AWS CloudWatch, New Relic) to monitor the system's performance and health during the initial phase of production.
- **Document Issues:** Keep a log of any issues encountered during deployment and how they were resolved.
- **User Training:** Provide training and documentation to users on how to use the system.
- **Handover and Support:** Handover the system to the operations team for ongoing support and maintenance.

## 5. Rollback Plan

### 5.1 Rollback Strategy
In case of deployment failure or critical issues during or after deployment, the following rollback strategy will be employed:
- **Revert to Previous Version:** Use backup and version control to revert the system to the last known good state.
- **Data Restoration:** Restore any affected data from backups taken before the deployment.
- **System Verification:** After rollback, verify that the system is functioning correctly and that no data has been lost.

### 5.2 Rollback Scenarios
- **Deployment Script Failure:** If deployment scripts fail, stop the deployment, fix the issue, and re-deploy. If the issue persists, roll back to the previous version.
- **Critical Bug in Production:** If a critical bug is found in production that affects trading or user access, immediately roll back to the staging version or previous production version.

## 6. Monitoring and Post-Deployment Support

### 6.1 Monitoring Tools
- **AWS CloudWatch:** Monitor system performance, resource usage, and application logs.
- **New Relic:** Monitor Web App performance and user interactions.
- **MetaTrader Logs:** Monitor MT4 EA logs for any issues with trading signal execution.

### 6.2 Post-Deployment Support
- **Support Team Availability:** Ensure that the support team is available during the initial deployment phase to address any issues that arise.
- **Issue Tracking:** Use an issue tracking system (e.g., JIRA, GitHub Issues) to log and manage any post-deployment issues.
- **Feedback Loop:** Gather feedback from users and stakeholders to identify areas for improvement.

## 7. Risks and Mitigations

### 7.1 Deployment Risks
- **Incorrect Configuration:** Risk of misconfiguring the system during deployment.
- **System Downtime:** Potential downtime during the transition to production.

### 7.2 Mitigation Strategies
- **Thorough Testing:** Ensure that all configurations are thoroughly tested in the staging environment before production deployment.
- **Scheduled Downtime:** Plan deployment during off-peak hours to minimize impact on users.
