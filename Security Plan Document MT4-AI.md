# Security Plan Document for MT4-AI Trading System

---

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose
The purpose of this Security Plan Document is to outline the security measures, protocols, and best practices that will be implemented to protect the MT4-AI Trading System. This document aims to ensure that all components of the system are secure, that data is protected, and that access is controlled and monitored.

### 1.2 Scope
This document covers the security considerations for all components of the MT4-AI Trading System, including the MT4 Expert Advisor (EA), the Machine Learning "Brain," and the Web Application. It includes guidelines for securing data, controlling access, monitoring activity, and responding to security incidents.

## 2. Security Objectives

### 2.1 Data Protection
- **Confidentiality:** Ensure that sensitive data, such as trading signals and user information, is only accessible to authorized individuals.
- **Integrity:** Protect data from unauthorized modification or corruption.
- **Availability:** Ensure that the system and data are available to authorized users when needed.

### 2.2 Access Control
- Implement strong authentication and authorization mechanisms to control access to the system.
- Ensure that users have the minimum necessary access to perform their roles.

### 2.3 Monitoring and Auditing
- Continuously monitor the system for security events and potential threats.
- Maintain logs and audit trails of all access and activity within the system.

### 2.4 Incident Response
- Develop and implement an incident response plan to quickly address and mitigate security incidents.

## 3. Data Security

### 3.1 Data Encryption
- **In Transit:** All data transmitted between components (MT4 EA, "Brain," Web App) will be encrypted using SSL/TLS to protect against interception and eavesdropping.
- **At Rest:** Sensitive data stored in databases, logs, and backups will be encrypted using AES-256 or equivalent encryption standards.

### 3.2 Data Access Control
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** Implement RBAC to ensure that users only have access to the data and resources necessary for their roles.
- **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):** Require MFA for accessing sensitive components, such as the Web App's administrative interface and AWS management console.

### 3.3 Data Retention and Disposal
- **Retention Policy:** Define data retention policies to ensure that data is retained for only as long as necessary to meet business and legal requirements.
- **Secure Disposal:** Ensure that data is securely deleted or destroyed when it is no longer needed, using methods such as data wiping or cryptographic erasure.

---

## 4. Access Control

### 4.1 User Authentication
- **Password Policies:** Enforce strong password policies, including minimum length, complexity requirements, and periodic password changes.
- **Single Sign-On (SSO):** Consider implementing SSO to simplify user authentication and improve security.
- **API Key Management:** Use API keys for authentication of API requests, and regularly rotate keys to minimize the risk of compromise.

### 4.2 Authorization
- **Least Privilege:** Grant users the minimum permissions necessary to perform their tasks.
- **Access Reviews:** Regularly review and update user permissions to ensure they are appropriate for current roles and responsibilities.

### 4.3 Access Logging and Monitoring
- **Audit Logs:** Maintain detailed logs of all access to the system, including successful and failed login attempts, changes to user permissions, and access to sensitive data.
- **Real-Time Monitoring:** Implement real-time monitoring tools (e.g., AWS CloudWatch, Splunk) to detect and alert on suspicious activity.

---

## 5. Network Security

### 5.1 Firewall Configuration
- **AWS Security Groups:** Configure AWS Security Groups to control inbound and outbound traffic to EC2 instances, allowing only necessary ports and IP ranges.
- **Network Segmentation:** Use Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) and subnet segmentation to isolate sensitive components from less critical parts of the network.

### 5.2 Intrusion Detection and Prevention
- **IDS/IPS:** Deploy Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) and Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS) to detect and block potential threats.
- **DDoS Protection:** Use AWS Shield and other DDoS protection services to guard against distributed denial-of-service attacks.

### 5.3 Secure API Gateway
- **API Gateway Security:** Use AWS API Gateway or similar services to securely expose APIs, implementing rate limiting, API key management, and request validation.

---

## 6. Incident Response

### 6.1 Incident Response Plan
- **Preparation:** Define roles and responsibilities for the incident response team, and establish communication channels for coordinating response efforts.
- **Detection and Analysis:** Implement tools and processes to detect security incidents and analyze their impact on the system.
- **Containment and Eradication:** Develop procedures for containing security incidents and eradicating threats from the system.
- **Recovery:** Establish processes for restoring affected systems and data to normal operation after an incident.

### 6.2 Incident Reporting
- **Internal Reporting:** Require all employees and users to report potential security incidents to the incident response team.
- **External Reporting:** Establish procedures for reporting incidents to external stakeholders, including customers, regulators, and law enforcement, as required.

### 6.3 Post-Incident Review
- **Lessons Learned:** Conduct a post-incident review to identify the root cause of the incident and improve security measures to prevent future occurrences.
- **Documentation:** Document the incident, response actions, and outcomes in an incident report.

---

## 7. Security Monitoring and Auditing

### 7.1 Continuous Monitoring
- **Monitoring Tools:** Use AWS CloudWatch, Splunk, or similar tools to continuously monitor system performance, security events, and user activity.
- **Alerts and Notifications:** Set up automated alerts and notifications for potential security incidents, such as unauthorized access attempts or unusual system activity.

### 7.2 Regular Security Audits
- **Internal Audits:** Conduct regular internal security audits to assess the effectiveness of security controls and identify potential vulnerabilities.
- **External Audits:** Engage third-party security experts to perform external audits and penetration testing to validate the system's security posture.

### 7.3 Vulnerability Management
- **Patch Management:** Regularly apply security patches and updates to all system components to address known vulnerabilities.
- **Vulnerability Scanning:** Perform regular vulnerability scans using tools like Nessus or OpenVAS to identify and remediate security weaknesses.

---

## 8. Compliance and Legal Considerations

### 8.1 Regulatory Compliance
- **GDPR Compliance:** Ensure that the system complies with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) for processing and storing personal data of EU citizens.
- **Industry Standards:** Adhere to relevant industry standards and best practices, such as ISO/IEC 27001 for information security management.

### 8.2 Data Privacy
- **Data Minimization:** Collect and process only the data necessary for the system's operation, and ensure that data processing is transparent to users.
- **User Consent:** Obtain explicit user consent for collecting and processing personal data, and provide mechanisms for users to withdraw consent and request data deletion.
