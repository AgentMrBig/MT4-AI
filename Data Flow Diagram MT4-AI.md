## 4. Data Handling and Transformation

### 4.1 Live Market Data Handling
- **Collection:** The MT4 EA continuously collects live market data, including price, volume, and technical indicators.
- **Transmission:** This data is sent to the "Brain" via a RESTful API in real-time.
- **Processing:** The "Brain" processes this data to identify trading opportunities based on pre-trained models and live analysis.

### 4.2 Trading Signal Generation
- **Analysis:** The "Brain" analyzes the incoming data using its Data Analysis & Signal Generation Module.
- **Signal Creation:** Based on the analysis, the "Brain" generates buy/sell signals.
- **Transmission:** These signals are sent back to the MT4 EA for immediate execution.

### 4.3 Configuration and Monitoring
- **User Requests:** Users can send configuration and monitoring requests via the Web App.
- **Processing:** The "Brain" processes these requests and adjusts its parameters accordingly.
- **Feedback:** The Web App receives feedback and updates from the "Brain," providing real-time monitoring capabilities.

## 5. Data Security and Privacy

### 5.1 Data Encryption
- **In Transit:** All data transmitted between the MT4 EA, "Brain," and Web App will be encrypted using SSL/TLS protocols to ensure data integrity and privacy.
- **At Rest:** Sensitive data, such as historical trading data and user configurations, will be encrypted using industry-standard encryption techniques.

### 5.2 Access Control
- **Authentication:** Access to the Web App and "Brain" components will require multi-factor authentication (MFA) to prevent unauthorized access.
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** Different levels of access will be implemented based on user roles, ensuring that only authorized users can make critical changes to the system.
