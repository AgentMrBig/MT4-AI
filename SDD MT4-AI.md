# System Design Document (SDD) for MT4-AI Trading System

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose
The purpose of this document is to provide a comprehensive design for the MT4-AI Trading System. This includes detailed descriptions of the system architecture, components, data flow, and interactions. The document aims to guide the implementation and integration phases by offering clear insights into the system’s structure and functionality.

### 1.2 Scope
This SDD focuses on the design of a machine learning-based trading system that interacts with the MT4 platform to receive market data, analyze it, and send trading signals back to the platform for execution. The system leverages AWS for machine learning processing, genetic algorithm optimization, and web-based monitoring.

## 2. System Overview

### 2.1 System Architecture
The system architecture consists of the following main components:
- **MT4 EA (Expert Advisor):** A script running on MT4 that streams live market data to the "Brain" and executes trading signals received from it.
- **"Brain" (Machine Learning Engine):** Hosted on AWS, this component is responsible for data analysis, signal generation, and continuous learning using genetic algorithms.
- **Web App:** A web-based interface for monitoring, configuring, and analyzing the system’s performance.

## 3. Component Descriptions

### 3.1 MT4 Expert Advisor (EA)
- **Role:** The EA serves as the interface between MT4 and the "Brain". It sends real-time market data (e.g., price, volume) to the "Brain" and executes the trading signals it receives.
- **Key Functions:**
  - **Data Streaming:** The EA streams data to the "Brain" via an API.
  - **Signal Execution:** It receives buy/sell signals and executes trades on the MT4 platform.
  - **Error Handling:** The EA manages errors such as connectivity issues and ensures that trades are executed accurately.

### 3.2 Machine Learning "Brain"
- **Role:** The "Brain" is the core decision-making component that analyzes market data, generates trading signals, and optimizes strategies using machine learning techniques.
- **Key Functions:**
  - **Historical Data Processing:** Pre-trains models using historical data to provide a head start.
  - **Data Analysis:** Continuously analyzes incoming live data to detect patterns, trends, and opportunities.
  - **Signal Generation:** Generates trading signals based on analysis and sends them to the EA.
  - **Genetic Algorithm Optimization:** Runs a genetic algorithm to refine and evolve trading strategies over time.
  - **Learning Feedback Loop:** Continuously improves by learning from the results of past trades.

### 3.3 Web Application
- **Role:** The web app provides a user interface for monitoring the system’s performance, configuring parameters, and analyzing trading activity.
- **Key Functions:**
  - **Real-Time Monitoring:** Displays live data, trade executions, and system status.
  - **Historical Analysis:** Provides insights into past trades, performance metrics, and model predictions.
  - **Configuration Management:** Allows users to adjust parameters such as risk tolerance, trade sizes, and strategy preferences.
  - **User Authentication:** Ensures that only authorized users can access the system.

## 4. Detailed Data Flow

### 4.1 Data Ingestion
- **From MT4 to "Brain":**
  - The EA sends market data to the "Brain" via a RESTful API. This data includes real-time price quotes, volumes, and possibly other indicators like moving averages.
  
- **From Historical Data to "Brain":**
  - The "Brain" periodically pulls historical data from AWS S3 (or a similar storage service) for training and retraining models. This data is crucial for initial model training and for running the genetic algorithm.

### 4.2 Signal Processing
- **In the "Brain":**
  - Upon receiving data, the "Brain" processes it through its machine learning models, identifies potential trading opportunities, and generates buy/sell signals.
  - These signals are then sent back to the EA for execution.

### 4.3 Feedback Loop
- **Genetic Algorithm Optimization:**
  - The "Brain" simulates trading over historical data, iterating over different strategies using a genetic algorithm. The best-performing strategies are selected and applied to live trading.
  
- **Learning from Live Data:**
  - The results of executed trades (e.g., success/failure, profit/loss) are fed back into the system to continuously improve the decision-making process.

## 5. Interface Specifications

### 5.1 MT4 EA to "Brain" API
- **Protocol:** RESTful HTTP API
- **Data Format:** JSON
- **Endpoints:**
  - **/stream_data:** Receives live market data.
  - **/get_signal:** Sends trading signals back to MT4 EA.

### 5.2 Web App to "Brain" API
- **Protocol:** RESTful HTTP API
- **Data Format:** JSON
- **Endpoints:**
  - **/monitor:** Fetches real-time system status.
  - **/configure:** Allows users to change system parameters.
  - **/history:** Retrieves historical trading data and performance metrics.

## 6. Security Considerations

### 6.1 Data Encryption
- **In Transit:** All data transmitted between the MT4 EA, the "Brain," and the web app will be encrypted using SSL/TLS.
- **At Rest:** Sensitive data stored in AWS (e.g., historical data, trade records) will be encrypted using AWS KMS (Key Management Service).

### 6.2 User Authentication
- The web app will implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) to ensure that only authorized users can access and configure the system.

### 6.3 Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
- Different roles (e.g., Trader, Developer, Administrator) will be defined with specific permissions to access different parts of the system.

## 7. Testing Strategy

### 7.1 Unit Testing
- Each component will be tested independently to ensure correct functionality. For example, the EA’s ability to stream data and the "Brain’s" ability to generate signals will be tested separately.

### 7.2 Integration Testing
- The system will be tested end-to-end, from data streaming to signal generation and execution, to ensure all components work together seamlessly.

### 7.3 Performance Testing
- Stress tests will be conducted to evaluate the system’s performance under heavy data loads and high-frequency trading conditions.

### 7.4 Security Testing
- Penetration tests will be carried out to identify and fix potential security vulnerabilities in the system.

## 8. Future Enhancements

### 8.1 Multi-Asset Trading
- Extend the system to trade multiple currency pairs and other asset classes such as commodities and indices.

### 8.2 Advanced Machine Learning Models
- Incorporate more sophisticated models such as deep learning and reinforcement learning to enhance the "Brain’s" predictive capabilities.

### 8.3 Adaptive Risk Management
- Implement dynamic risk management strategies that adapt to market conditions in real-time, adjusting position sizes and stop-loss levels accordingly.
