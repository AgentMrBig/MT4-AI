## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose
The purpose of this Test Plan Document is to outline the testing strategy, objectives, resources, schedule, and scope for the MT4-AI Trading System. This document will guide the testing process to ensure that the system functions as expected, is free from defects, and meets the specified requirements.

### 1.2 Scope
This document covers the testing of all components of the MT4-AI Trading System, including the MT4 Expert Advisor (EA), the Machine Learning "Brain," and the Web Application. The testing will include unit testing, integration testing, system testing, performance testing, and security testing.

## 2. Testing Objectives

### 2.1 Functional Testing
- Ensure that all features of the MT4 EA, "Brain," and Web App work according to the specifications.
- Validate that data flows correctly between the MT4 EA, "Brain," and Web App.

### 2.2 Performance Testing
- Evaluate the system's performance under various load conditions, including high-frequency trading scenarios.
- Measure response times for the "Brain" when processing real-time data and generating signals.

### 2.3 Security Testing
- Verify that the system is protected against unauthorized access.
- Ensure that data is encrypted both in transit and at rest.
- Test the effectiveness of role-based access control (RBAC) and multi-factor authentication (MFA).

### 2.4 Integration Testing
- Test the integration points between the MT4 EA, "Brain," and Web App to ensure seamless communication.
- Validate that API requests and responses are correctly handled across components.

### 2.5 User Acceptance Testing (UAT)
- Engage with end-users to validate that the system meets their expectations and is user-friendly.
